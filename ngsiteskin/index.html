				<p class="title">Newgrounds Site Skin Customiser</p>
				<p>NGSS is a userscript which lets you change the look of Newgrounds to whatever you want. You can choose backgrounds from a list of previously used site skins or upload your own. You can also customise other parts of the site too.</p>
				<p>If you have made a site skin in the past and want it included/removed from the script. Message me and I'll sort that out for you.</p>
				<b>Main features:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Changeable background image</li>
					<li>Changeable text and icon colour theme</li>
					<li>Transparent background</li>
					<li>Presets that can be imported/exported</li>
					<li>Custom CSS</li>
					<li>More features that are listed further down the page</li>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<b>Download:</b>
				<p>There is no public download link for this script.</p>
				<p>Site skin changing is due to be a supporter only feature at some point in the future. As it's meant to be paid for, I have mixed feelings about making this a free download. So despite being given <a id="permission">permission from Tom</a>, I will not be publicly giving this away.</p>
				<p>I will still give out download links though. If you make a site skin, put it on the art portal, and send it to me, I will give you the latest version of the script. Your skill level doesn't matter, just actually put some effort into it. If you'd like I can also include the skin you made as a built-in option for others to choose too.</p>
				<p><a href="template.png">Here's a template to get started.</a></p>
				<p>If you're not an artist, message me anyway, we can figure something out. If you have already made a site skin in the past, also message me and I will just give you a download link.</p>
				<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> I won't be giving away download links until I have auto-updating 100% working. This is to save me the hassle of messaging everyone who has the script whenever I make an update.</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Installation:</b>
				<ul>

					<li>Press the download link sent to you to install the script. Tampermonkey should pop-up to prompt you to install</li>
