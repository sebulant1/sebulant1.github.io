						<b>Wanted!</b>
						<p>Wanted! is a PC and mobile web game where you must spot a hidden character hiding amongst a crowd. It's based off the old DS Mario minigame with the same name.</p>
						<p>It was a big collaboration game with over 150 artists taking part to draw all the character sprites.</p>
						<p>In the end this game got frontpaged, Daily 2nd, Weekly 3rd and Best of the Month. What a line-up.</p>

						<b>BYLE</b>
						<p>BYLE is a top down rogue-like shooter. You play as a strangely cuboid shaped character roaming the streets of a city overrun by a hivemind substance known as BYLE. Pick up powerups and new weapons as enemies randomly generated levels get harder and harder.</p>
						<p>The game was my final project for university, and I worked on it with 6 other people in the beautiful team we call ST. JARLE. We were nominated for best game of our year, but lost to the other team that had a more visually appealing game (copium).</p>
